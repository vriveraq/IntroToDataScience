# Introduction To Data Science
This repository contains R code from the assignments in the course Introduction to Data Science at University of Illinois. While I provide my code here, I strongly discourage any students using as their own. You can gather inspiration or ideas from other's work but academic integrity and making your own work is an important part of learning.


It contains the write up in a pdf format and accompaning R code for each assignment for a total of 9 Homework assignments.
